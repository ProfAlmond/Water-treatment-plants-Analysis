# Water-treatment-plants-Analysis
In this analysis, I utilized R Studio to compute the removal efficiency of each water waste treatment plant using the dplyr and magrittr libraries. Firstly, I identified the chemical compounds with an influent value above 200 and conducted a descriptive analysis of the mean and standard deviation of each chemical compound in every water waste treatment plant.

Next, I computed the removal efficiency for each chemical compound and compound class in every water treatment plant and performed a comparative analysis to identify the most efficient plant for each chemical and compound class. To visualize the results, I used the ggplot2 package to create visually appealing charts depicting the removal efficiency for each water treatment plant.

Furthermore, I documented the analysis in an R markdown file, which was then knitted to a PDF and PowerPoint for presentation purposes. This allowed for a clear and concise presentation of the analysis, with all relevant information and visual aids included.

Overall, this analysis provides valuable insights into the removal efficiency of different water treatment plants and highlights the importance of effective monitoring and control in protecting the environment and public health. The use of R and its associated libraries, as well as the documentation and presentation of the analysis in R markdown, allowed for a rigorous and thorough approach to the analysis.
